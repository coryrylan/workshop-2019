# Workshop for this step

Goals:

* Add several new components to the app.

-----

1. Generate the videoDashboard component and all nested components. Add
   the 'dashboard/' prefix.
   For example, your commands may look something like this:

```
ng generate component dashboard/videoDashboard
ng generate component dashboard/videoList
ng generate component dashboard/videoPlayer
```

(On StackBlitz, right-click the dashboard folder and choose to
generate each new component. Enter "videoDashboard" or
"video-dashboard" at the prompt.)

2. Assemble your static application.

Use the components you generated in step 1 to reconstruct the video
stat tracker app in the dashboard component. As you begin, of course,
the components will be placeholders without actual functionality.
