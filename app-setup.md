# Workshop for this step

Goals:

- Create an Angular app with the CLI.
- Add several new components to the app.

---

1. Use your terminal to navigate to the desired location for your new
   project. Once you are there, type the following command:

```
ng new workshop-app
```

2. Change directories into the workshop-app folder that was generated by
   Angular CLI:

```
cd workshop-app
```

Then start Angular CLI in development mode:

```
npm start
```

Once the terminal reports that "Ready for changes", the
application is ready to load.

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/

You should see the resulting application.

3. Generate the videoDashboard component and all nested components. Add
   the 'dashboard/' prefix.
   For example, your commands may look something like this:

```
ng generate component dashboard/videoDashboard
ng generate component dashboard/videoList
ng generate component dashboard/videoPlayer
```

(On StackBlitz, right-click the dashboard folder and choose to
generate each new component. Enter "videoDashboard" or
"video-dashboard" at the prompt.)

2. Assemble your static application.

Use the components you generated in step 1 to reconstruct the video
stat tracker app in the dashboard component. As you begin, of course,
the components will be placeholders without actual functionality.
